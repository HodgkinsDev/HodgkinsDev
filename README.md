Hi, I’m @HodgkinsDev 

I’m interested in Original Xbox programming mainly, though I will release the odd random tool or program.

I'm learning pygame on the side, as I have lots of experince in python, but never looked at pygame. You'll probably see random games and stuff like that too.

I'm new to Github, but have lots of projects which I've completed that I need to add. I also have lots of projects in the works!
