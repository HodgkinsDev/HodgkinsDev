Hi, I’m @HodgkinsDev 

I’m interested in Original Xbox programming mainly, though I will release the odd random tool or program.

I'm learning pygame on the side, so you'll probably see random games and stuff like that aswell.

I'm new to Github, but have lots of projects which I've completed that I need to add. I also have lots of projects in the works!
